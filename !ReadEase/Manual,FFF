# ReadEase

By Richard Wareham <rjw57@cantab.net>

**Note:** This program was written for RISC OS and first appeared in ``*info``
in Acorn User magazine in October 1994. It is written in BBC Basic and is no
longer actively maintained.

 ReadEase is a program which calculates how easy a
certain text file is to read. It gives as an output
a thing called a 'Reading Ease Quotient'. The higher 
this number the more difficult it is to read. The 
average age of a child that could read this is the 
same as the Reading Ease Quotient for values less 
than 16. After this the numbers are just a measure 
of how difficult the file is to read. For example 
say for two files you had the figures 7.6 and 23.4. 
The former value can be used as the average age but 
the second can't. You can however compare the two 
values as Reading Ease Quotients have no upper 
limit.

## How Does it Work Out the Reading Ease Quotient?

 The program works out the Reading Ease Quotient by 
using a formula called the FOG formula. It was 
invented by an american psycologist named Gunning in
1952. The formula is :-

```
   F = 0.4(W + P)+5
```

 Where F is the Reading Ease Quotient, W is the mean
number of words per sentence and P is the percentage
of words with more than 3 or more syllables
(excluding those ending in -ed or -ing). This is
the formula at the heart of ReadEase.

## How Does it Work Out How Many Syllables are in a word?

 The formula is complex. This however is of my own
creation. It uses several rules to enumerate the 
number of syllables in the word. I have included a
second program named '!Syllables'. This produces a
printout (so be sure to have your printer connected)
of the breakdown of a typed in sentence. It shows
how the program deciphers the syllable clues. Every
time it finds a clue it shows it on the printout.
This will tell you if it adds or subtracts one from 
the final amount. It shouldn't be too difficult to
see how it works.

## Loading a file

 This couldn't be simpler. Just drag any text file
onto the icon. It will change from having a cross
through it to being clear. A window showing the 
results will apper. From this you can read off the
Reading Ease Quotient. You can load files into
ReadEase as many times as you want. It will clear
the last file and replace int with the new file.
