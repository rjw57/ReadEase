On the other hand once the definition is provided the theorem ceases to be obvious, since the result it asserts is quite different from the defining property and to show that the first follows the second is not a trivial task. If it is objected that we should take as definition some property designed to make the proof simpler, the answer is that there are many other 'obvious' and important properties of coninuous functions and no definition simplifies them all simultaneously. We might of course lump together everything we want of a continuous function, and call a function continuous whenever it has these properties. Apart from the crudity and clumsiness of such a procedure, we should thereby entirely obscure the fact that all such properties in fact flow from one simple basic one; we should lose all insight into the relative depths of the properties and into the nature of their interconnections; we might even unwittingly include properties that were subtly inconsistent; and it would take too long to decide whether a given function was continuous.
